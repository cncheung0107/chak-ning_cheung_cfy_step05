      <h1>JACKIE CHAN</h1>
      <p>
        Jackie Chan is one of my favorite film stars because he combines comedy, action, and real athletic skill.
        His movies often feel energetic and optimistic, and the stunts show an incredible amount of effort and creativity.

      <p>
        I like Jackie Chan because his action scenes tell a story instead of being only loud or violent.
        He uses the environment as part of the choreography: ladders, chairs, markets, buses, and even small items
        become tools in a fight. His style is also funny, which makes the characters feel human and relatable.
        Even when the hero is strong, he still gets tired, makes mistakes, and has to improvise. That mix of humor
        and hard work makes the movies exciting to watch. Jackie Chan’s career also shows persistence. He started
        as a stunt performer and worked for many years to develop his own identity on screen. When I watch his films,
        I feel motivated to practice, improve, and stay positive.
